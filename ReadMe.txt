2. As a huge project, some interesting feactures wasn't able to join within short time
3. Visual studio was a great platfrom for working, but due to its a very large file to work, it requires 
   a lots of time.

Overall, it was a only a basic project for the student. A huge development can be possible in the police if this
project is used for real life. The slow rate case solution will be geared to more first.It will be a great solution
for the both civilian and the polices.
